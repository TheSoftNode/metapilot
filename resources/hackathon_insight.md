Yes, your project **MetaPilot** fits well into the **AI-Powered Web3 Agents & Autonomous dApps** track based on the judging criteria. Here's how it aligns:

### **Key Alignment Points:**
1. **AI-Driven Automation**  
   - Your project uses AI to automate Web3 tasks (DAO voting, reward claiming, token purchasing), which directly matches the track's focus on **AI-powered agents and autonomous dApps**.
   - The personalization aspect (automation based on user preferences) aligns with "personalized, AI-driven DeFi or NFT recommendations."

2. **Autonomous Smart Contract Execution**  
   - If MetaPilot executes transactions (e.g., auto-voting in DAOs, claiming rewards, or buying tokens), it demonstrates **AI-enhanced smart contracts** or **on-chain AI agents for portfolio management**.

3. **Embedded Wallet Integration (Required)**  
   - The judging criteria require **MetaMask Embedded Wallet SDK** (Web3Auth) for seedless wallet creation via social/email login.  
   - Ensure your demo clearly shows this integration in the main flow (e.g., users log in via Google/Gmail and get a wallet without seed phrases).

4. **Deployment on Solana (Required)**  
   - The project must be deployed on Solana (or Solana + another chain for cross-chain).  
   - If MetaPilot interacts with Solana-based DAOs or DeFi protocols, this requirement is satisfied. If not, you may need to adapt the backend.

### **Possible Improvements for Stronger Fit:**
- **Highlight AI‚Äôs Role in Governance**  
  If MetaPilot can analyze DAO proposals and auto-vote based on AI logic (e.g., sentiment analysis or historical patterns), it could qualify as **"Autonomous DAOs with AI governance."**
  
- **Showcase Personalization**  
  Demo how AI tailors strategies (e.g., optimizing reward claims or token swaps based on user behavior).

- **Cross-Chain Consideration**  
  If already multi-chain, emphasize Solana + another chain (e.g., Ethereum) to qualify for the cross-chain track.

### **Final Assessment:**  
‚úÖ **Fits the track** if:  
- Uses **Web3Auth (MetaMask Embedded Wallet)** for onboarding.  
- Runs on **Solana** (or Solana + another chain).  
- Showcases **AI automation** in the demo (e.g., bot executing a vote/trade autonomously).  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs adjustments if:**  
- Missing embedded wallet integration or Solana deployment.  

Would recommend double-checking the **Web3Auth SDK integration** and **Solana compatibility** to fully meet judging criteria. If those are in place, MetaPilot is a strong contender! üöÄ
