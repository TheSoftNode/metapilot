Qualification Requirements
The app should have integrated the MetaMask Embedded Wallet SDKs (Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs) and use social/email login for instant, seedless wallet creation and management.

The dApp should be deployed on the Solana blockchain. If opting for the cross chain track, it should be Solana + any other chain.

Use any of the following SDKs based on your platform:

Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDK:

React Hooks: SDK Reference, Examples

Vue Composables: SDK Reference, Examples

JavaScript (for all frameworks): SDK Reference, Examples

Web3Auth Plug and Play Mobile SDKs:

Android: SDK Reference, Examples

iOS: SDK Reference, Examples

React Native: SDK Reference, Examples

Flutter: SDK Reference, Examples

Web3Auth Plug and Play Gaming SDKs

Unity: SDK Reference, Examples

Unreal: SDK Reference, Examples

The demo should have a working MetaMask Embedded Wallet integration depicted in the main flow of the application.

Maximum prize that can be earned by a team: $5000 ( Best Overall)

Teams can choose to participate in multiple tracks at once, but will be considered only for one track by the judges for being a winner

The judges can choose to reward a team Best Overall, without them winning a track prize

The judges can decide not to reward a track prize if no project meets the standards set by them internally, apart from the basic submission criteria.

Submission Requirements
Demo & Code:

Submit a working demo (live or recorded video) showing key features.

Provide access to source code (GitHub or similar), with clear instructions for setup and testing.

Documentation:

Include a brief README or documentation explaining:

Project goals and features

How Web3Auth is integrated

Instructions for running the demo

Pitch:

Submit a short project description (100â€“300 words) outlining the problem, solution, and impact.

Judging Criteria

Build decentralized applications or agents that leverage artificial intelligence for automation, personalization, or smart contract execution.

Projects should showcase how decentralized AI can drive smarter contracts, autonomous DAOs, or user-facing agents (e.g., chatbots, workflow bots) that operate on-chain. Use embedded wallets to streamline user onboarding, asset management, or transaction approvals, but let the AI-driven experience shine.

Possible Directions:
- AI-enhanced smart contracts
- Autonomous DAOs with AI governance
- Personalized, AI-driven DeFi or NFT recommendations
- On-chain AI agents for portfolio management
